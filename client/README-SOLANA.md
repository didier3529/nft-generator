# Solana Integration for NFT Generator

This document provides instructions for testing the Solana blockchain integration in the NFT Generator app.

## Overview

The integration includes:

1. Phantom wallet connection
2. Deploy to Solana functionality
3. IPFS upload for NFT metadata
4. Clear disclaimers about blockchain risks

## Minimal Implementation

This integration is intentionally minimal, focusing on core functionality without complicating the existing codebase. Key features are implemented with approximately 20 lines for wallet connection and 30 lines for deployment function.

## Setup Instructions

### Polyfill Configuration
Since Webpack 5 no longer includes Node.js polyfills by default, this project uses CRACO to configure the necessary polyfills:

1. The required polyfills are already installed:
   - crypto-browserify
   - stream-browserify
   - path-browserify
   - os-browserify
   - buffer
   - process

2. The webpack configuration in `craco.config.js` provides fallbacks for Node.js modules.

3. Package.json has been updated to use CRACO instead of react-scripts.

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) browser extension
2. Create a Solana wallet or import an existing one
3. Switch your wallet to Devnet network (for testing)
4. Get some devnet SOL tokens from a [Solana Faucet](https://solfaucet.com/)
5. Create a free account at [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) and get an API key

### Step 1: Start the Application

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to the "Preview & Configure" tab
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner
3. Select Phantom wallet from the modal
4. Approve the connection request in the Phantom extension
5. You should see your abbreviated wallet address displayed

### Step 3: Create an NFT

1. Select layers for your NFT using the trait selector
2. Customize the NFT appearance to your liking
3. Verify that your NFT appears correctly in the canvas

### Step 4: Deploy to Solana

1. Click the "Deploy to Solana" button
2. Enter a name and description for your NFT
3. Paste your NFT.Storage API key in the designated field
4. Click "Deploy NFT"
5. Approve the transaction in your Phantom wallet
6. Wait for the deployment to complete
7. Verify the success message with NFT address and metadata URI

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Copy the NFT address from the success message
2. Visit [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)
3. Paste the address into the search bar
4. Verify that your NFT appears in the explorer with the correct metadata
5. Check that your NFT appears in your Phantom wallet (may require refreshing)

## Important Notes

- This implementation uses Solana's devnet for testing
- No backend changes were made; all functionality is client-side
- No user data is collected or stored
- Users handle their own wallet connections and pay gas fees
- All necessary disclaimers for anonymity protection are included

## Troubleshooting

- If the wallet connection fails, try refreshing the page
- If the deployment takes too long, check if you have sufficient devnet SOL
- If IPFS upload fails, verify your NFT.Storage API key
- If the transaction fails, check the error message in Phantom wallet
- If you encounter Node.js polyfill errors, ensure CRACO is properly configured and all dependencies are installed

## Security Considerations

This is a minimal implementation for demonstration purposes only. For production use, consider additional security measures such as:

- More robust error handling
- Transaction retry mechanisms 
- Server-side validation
- Rate limiting
- Alternative IPFS providers or dedicated storage
- More comprehensive wallet support
