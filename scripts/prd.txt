# Overview  
NFT Export is a web application that allows users to generate and export NFT collections. The platform makes the process of creating NFT art accessible to non-technical users by providing a layer-based generation system, similar to how artists use layers in design tools. Users can upload multiple image layers, customize traits, and generate a complete NFT collection with metadata ready for blockchain deployment.

# Core Features  
1. Layer Management System
   - What it does: Allows users to upload, organize, and manage image layers for NFT creation
   - Why it's important: Provides the foundation for creating varied NFTs with different visual traits
   - How it works: Users upload image layers categorized by trait types (background, body, eyes, etc.)

2. Real-time NFT Preview Canvas
   - What it does: Shows a live preview of the generated NFT with selected traits
   - Why it's important: Gives immediate visual feedback to users about their creation
   - How it works: Renders layers on canvas in the proper stacking order, updating as users select different traits

3. Metadata Editor
   - What it does: Enables users to define and edit NFT metadata attributes
   - Why it's important: Proper metadata is crucial for blockchain compatibility and marketplace representation
   - How it works: Provides forms to input collection name, description, and trait rarity information

4. Export Functionality
   - What it does: Exports the complete NFT collection as images and metadata files
   - Why it's important: Provides the final output needed for NFT minting
   - How it works: Generates all trait combinations based on user settings, creates image files and corresponding JSON metadata

# User Experience  
User Personas:
- Digital artists seeking to create NFT collections without coding knowledge
- NFT creators who want to streamline their workflow
- Web3 entrepreneurs launching digital collectible projects

Key User Flows:
- Onboarding: User learns about the platform capabilities
- Layer Upload: User uploads and organizes trait images
- Configuration: User sets up collection parameters and trait rarities
- Preview: User views sample NFTs before generation
- Export: User generates and downloads the complete collection

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- Frontend: Next.js 15 application with React and TypeScript
- State Management: Zustand for global state
- File Handling: Client-side file processing with browser APIs
- Image Processing: HTML Canvas for rendering and compositing layers
- Storage: Local browser storage for saving work in progress

## Data Models
- Layer: 
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - category: string
  - imageUrl: string
  - weight: number (for rarity)
  - traits: { [key: string]: string } (metadata attributes)

- NFT Collection:
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - symbol: string
  - baseUri: string
  - layers: Layer[]
  - previewNFTs: number[] (indices of combinations to show in preview)

## APIs and Integrations
- No backend required for MVP; all processing happens client-side
- Future integration potential with IPFS for decentralized storage

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Static website hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
- CDN for optimal image delivery

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- Risk: Canvas performance issues with complex layered images
  Mitigation: Implement image optimization and caching strategies

- Risk: Browser memory limitations with large collections
  Mitigation: Batch processing for large collections, progressive loading

- Risk: Inconsistent file handling across browsers
  Mitigation: Comprehensive testing across browsers, fallback mechanisms

## MVP Scope Management
- Risk: Feature creep extending development timeline
  Mitigation: Strict prioritization of MVP features, clearly defined phases

- Risk: Usability issues in the layer management system
  Mitigation: Early user testing with artists/creators, iterative improvements

## Resource Constraints
- Risk: Limited development resources
  Mitigation: Focus on client-side processing to eliminate backend complexity

- Risk: Image processing performance
  Mitigation: Optimize canvas operations, use worker threads for processing
